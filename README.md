# CS244-Paper-Reproduction

This repository is our final project for CS244: Advanced Topics in Networking, Spring 2020, Stanford.

We have reproduced figure 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, and 12 in paper "Multi-Resource Fair Queueing for Packet Processing".

The paper introduced a new scheduler algorithm, Dominant Resource Fairness Queuing (DRFQ), that provides share guarantees and strategy-proofness in multi-resource scheme. We implemented various python scripts to simulate performance of different scheduling algorithms and wrote NS2 simulators to reproduce DRFQ's behavior.

## Python simulation

All python simulation scripts are located in `figures` directory. As of our project, we have developed python simulators to reproduce figure 3, 4, 5, 11, and 12. To reproduce figure X, simply run `python figure_X.py`.

## NS2 simulation

To emulate Dominant Resource fairness Queuing algorithm, we write our own ns2 application and DRFQ scheduler.

To run ns2 emulation, you need to follow below steps:

1. Copy `drfq_app.h/cc` and `drfq_sched.h/cc` into `ns-2.35/apps/` directory.

2. Add Makefile rule in `ns-2.35/Makefile` (include `apps/drfq_app.o apps/drfq_sched.o` under `OBJ_CC`).

3. Add below lines in `ns-2.35/tcl/lib/ns-default.tcl` to set default values for DRFQ application:

    ```
    Application/DrfqApp set flowid_ 0
    Application/DrfqApp set profile0_ 10
    Application/DrfqApp set profile1_ 10
    ```
    It won't break anything if you ignore this step and just run our `drfq.tcl` script. But there are warnings shown up:

    ```
    warning: no class variable XXX
    	see tcl-object.tcl in tclcl for info about this warning.
    ```
    Similar default values can also be set for DrfqScheduler.

4. Finally, run `ns drfq.tcl` to run the emulated test and you will see output like:
    ```
    Flow 0: 9,10,10,10,10,6,5,5,5,5,4,3,3,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,10,10,10,10,10,
    Flow 1: 0,0,0,0,0,4,5,5,5,5,3,4,3,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,0,0,0,0,0,
    Flow 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,4,3,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
    ```
    It prints out the number of packets processed in each second for every flow.

5. To reproduce figure 9, simply copy the output to `figure_9.py` and then run `python figure_9.py`.
